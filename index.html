    <h2>Robert Bolton</h2>

    <img src="Rob Shock BW.jpg">

    <p>Son of a farm owner's son and a farm worker's daughter, a product of the love between 
    a boy who wanted to geek out and pretend he was an outlaw, and an actual outlaw. 
    Okay, that's not fair. My mom abided the law, for the most part. A cragley and littered 
    childhood has led to the abomoinaton that has been laid out before you. He wanted to be a rockstar,
    but what he really wanted was for the world to love him. He searched for his answers,
    he tried to find away. </p>
